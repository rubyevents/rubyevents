# Adding Sponsors to RubyEvents

This guide explains how to add sponsor information for conferences and events in the RubyEvents platform.

## Overview

Sponsor data is stored in YAML files within the conference/event directories. Each conference can have its own sponsors file that defines sponsor tiers and individual sponsor information.

## File Structure

Sponsors are stored in YAML files at:
```
data/{organization-name}/{event-name}/sponsors.yml
```

For example:
- [`data/rubykaigi/rubykaigi-2025/sponsors.yml`](https://github.com/rubyevents/rubyevents/blob/main/data/rubykaigi/rubykaigi-2025/sponsors.yml)
- [`data/railsconf/railsconf-2025/sponsors.yml`](https://github.com/rubyevents/rubyevents/blob/main/data/railsconf/railsconf-2025/sponsors.yml)

## YAML Structure

### Basic Structure

```yaml
---
- tiers:
    - name: "Tier Name"
      description: "Description of this sponsorship tier"
      level: 1  # Lower numbers = higher priority tiers
      sponsors:
        - name: "Company Name"
          website: https://example.com
          slug: CompanyName
          logo_url: https://example.com/logo.png
          badge: "Optional Badge Text"  # Optional: Special sponsor designation
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Check for Existing Sponsors File

First, check if a sponsors file already exists:

```bash
ls data/{organization}/{event}/sponsors.yml
```

### 2. Create or Edit the Sponsors File

If the file doesn't exist, create it:

```bash
touch data/{organization}/{event}/sponsors.yml
```

### 3. Gather Sponsor Information

For each sponsor, collect:
- Official company name
- Company website URL
- Logo image URL (preferably high-resolution)
- Sponsorship tier
- Any special designations

### 4. Structure the YAML

Start with the basic structure and add tiers in order of importance (lowest level number first):

```yaml
---
- tiers:
    - name: "Highest Tier"
      level: 1
      sponsors: []

    - name: "Next Tier"
      level: 2
      sponsors: []
```

### 5. Add Sponsors to Each Tier

Fill in the sponsor details for each tier:

```yaml
    sponsors:
      - name: "Company Name"
        website: https://company.com
        slug: CompanyName
        logo_url: https://conference.org/sponsors/company-logo.png
```

### 6. Validate the YAML

Ensure the YAML is properly formatted:

```bash
yarn format:yml
```
