SUMMARY:Real Software Engineering
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Glenn Vanderburg (InfoEther). Software engineer
 ing as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work.  It doesn't prod
 uce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them for lo
 w cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesn't produce sy
 stems at all. That's odd, because in every other field, the term "engine
 ering" is reserved for methods that work.

  existing application. My talk will describe how to smell out,in one day

SUMMARY:Domain-Driven Rails Redux
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Pat Maddox (Goldstar Events). Over the last 5 y
 ears, Rails apps have increased in size, complexity, and value provided 
 to businesses.  A few years back all we had to do was customize some gen

 ment meant that we could launch products and add features way faster tha
 n our competitors could.

 riented modeling with MongoDB. We'll cover common design patterns and co

SUMMARY:My Own Private Cloud: Making Rails Deployment Suck Less Without 
 Outsourcing Your Infrastructure
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Rich Kilmer (InfoEther), Chad Fowler (Ruby Cent
 ral, Inc.). Rails apps are a challenge to deploy -- it's a fact.  Tradit
 ionally, developers would wrestle with a lot of moving parts in an admin
 istrative task that delays and annoys.  As the number of Rails apps incr
 eases, deployment becomes a significant challenge particularly for devel
 opers new to Ruby/Rails.  The issue becomes compounded within larger com
 panies and enterprises.

SUMMARY:Creativity & Constraint
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Neal Ford (ThoughtWorks). Most people think tha

 st enough constraint, and figuring out what gives you that perfect level
  is harder than you think. This keynote investigates the relationship be
 tween creativity and constraint as it applies to software development in
  the modern world.

 Rails runs on new versions of Ruby.  The results of this work may be of 
 use to others that wish to document scenarios involving Rails and/or sys

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ryan Brown (Google, Inc.), David Masover (Forkb

 Mapper, and critical gems like redcloth and mechanize are working too. S
 pin-up time is less of an issue, and Duby has matured to provide unprece
 dented performance. Our latest development tools make the development pr

DESCRIPTION:Presented by John Athayde (InfoEther). Views are still the w
