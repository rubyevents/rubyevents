Happy New Year! 🎉

2025 was an incredible year for Ruby Events around the world and also for the [RubyEvents.org](https://rubyevents.org) platform!

To celebrate, we're releasing **RubyEvents Wrapped**!

A look back at talks, events, speakers, sponsors, and the Ruby community's year!

## 2025 in Numbers

In 2025, we added and backfilled over **450 events** and indexed over **2,500 new talks**!

The Ruby community delivered **1,043 talks** from **670 speakers** at **33 conferences** across **18 countries**!

You can find them all on [rubyevents.org](https://rubyevents.org)!

## Community Contributions

We also received incredible contributions from the community this year!

**478 pull requests** merged from **83 contributors** 🙌

Thank you to everyone who contributed code, reported bugs, added events, or helped improve RubyEvents.org!
