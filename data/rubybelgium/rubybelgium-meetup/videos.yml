    19.30 - Talk 1:

    By: Kevin Vanzandberghe
    Title: Mental Phlexibility
    Desc:
    Building on an already cutting-edge stack (Hotwire, Tailwind, Phlex) that made me challenge a lot of assumptions as a Rails developer, over the last 18 months, I decided to go all-in and challenge even more things we take for granted.
    Can we let Devise go? Can we get away with SQLite in production? Can we finally ditch Redis? Can E2E specs actually be fast?
    The answer might not be an enthusiastic yes for all, but there's a lot of value in asking and playing around.

    20.00 - Break
