    Save the date! On March 5th we'll have the Ruby meetup at Adler Planetarium.

    Please RSVP on meetup so we know how many to expect. We plan to close registration for the event March 2nd or when our RSVP count has hit room capacity. You DO NOT need to be an Illinois Resident for this particular event.
    Due to building safety regulations, we can only allow max 60 attendees to the planetarium's Education Hub.
    Reach out to Michelle or other organizers with any questions/issues.

    While the ticket to the planetarium is free, tickets for the sky shows are not included but available for purchase at the desk by the Accessible Entrance. Follow this link for a list of the available sky shows.

    Speaker: Ifat Ribon
    Speaker: Noel Rappin - “Does Ruby Love Me Back? What Developer Happiness Means in Ruby”

    Looking for people to give a demo, a talk, or a workshop on something Ruby on Rails related. Please reach out if interested. [or send ideas!]

    EVENT AND LOCATION DETAILS:
    Unfortunately, there will not be food served at this event. There is a cafe at the Adler that has food and drinks available for purchase. Menu can be viewed here.

    This event will be happening during Adler's hours of operation. We will be at Education Hub A.

    Please enter through the Accessible Entrance and head straight to the desk at the Accessible Entrance. Adler employees at the desk should be aware of the event and will be around to point you to the Education Hub A area. Staff at the desk will hand you a wristband that will give you standard museum access (i.e. shows not included, but available for purchase). Your display name on the Attendees list of this Meetup event will be what we use for our event names list. (If you go by a different name than your meetup display name, please message Michelle at michelle@zooniverse.org and she will make sure that your preferred name is on the event list.)

    The Education Hub should be straight ahead once you have entered the Accessible Entrance, near the vending machines and right across from the restrooms. Follow this link for an onsite map. Note that the Accessible Entrance and the Education Hub is in the Mid-level section of the planetarium.

    Can't join in person? No problem!
    This event will be recorded and live streamed via Zoom. Zoom link can be found here:
