description: |-
  A friendly, regional Ruby conference in the mountains of western North Carolina. We spend most of the year heads-down in our own projects and codebases. Once in a while, it’s good to step back and survey the horizon, alongside a few companions. “Take a break from the gem mine, and get up to the ridge line.”
