  title: "How To Finish What You Start: Lessons From Actually Shipping a Big Refactor"
  description: |-
    Every developer has at least one major refactor they would love to make happen. Somehow, these projects are tough to start and even tougher to finish. My team recently completed a major overhaul of our permissions and access system, and it felt great to actually get one of these big refactors done. In this talk, I'll share the practical lessons that helped us ship it without breaking things or losing momentum, so you can finish your next big change too.

  title: "Yes, &…: Ruby’s Secret Talent for Improvisation"
  description: |-
    Did you know Ruby is an improviser? With its ability to take blocks at will, Ruby lets methods pass the conversation to blocks that happily accept what’s given and add to it. This talk explores blocks, procs, and lambdas as Ruby’s way of saying “Yes, and…”, with playful examples, surprising behavior, and joyful chaos along the way.

  title: "State is the First Decision You Never Made"
  description: |-
    Web apps are built on a paradox: stateful experiences over a stateless web. State decisions permeate the stack, yet are often made implicitly while teams debate frameworks, APIs, or architecture. This talk shows how those decisions shape real features and how to build *with* the web platform instead of fighting it.
