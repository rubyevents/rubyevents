    The lights cut out. The crowd roars. It’s time. The band takes the stage. They’ve practiced the songs, particularly the covers. They’ve sound checked the coverage of the speakers. They know the lighting rig has the proper colored gels covering the lamps. They’re nervous, but they’ve got it all covered.

    Similarly, code coverage can give you confidence before your app performs on production and also tell you how live code is used (or not used). We’ll cover how to leverage ruby’s different coverage measurement techniques in concert to assist your crew and delight your audience.

    Pair programming is intimate. It’s the closest collaboration we do as software developers. When it goes well, it feels great! But when it doesn’t, you might be left feeling frustrated, discouraged, or withdrawn.

    To navigate the vulnerability of sharing our keyboard and code, let’s learn about nonviolent communication (NVC), an established practice of deep listening to ourselves and others. We’ll cover real-life examples and how to apply the four tenets of NVC — observations, feelings, needs, and requests — to bring more joy and fulfillment the next time you pair.

    Have you ever considered building a machine learning model in Ruby? It may surprise you to learn that you can train, build, and deploy ML models in Ruby. But what are the benefits of using Ruby over other languages?

    One of the biggest advantages of using Ruby for machine learning is accessibility. You’re no longer limited to specific languages or tools when exploring AI and ML concepts. It’s time for Rubyists to dive into the world of machine learning!

    In this talk, we’ll build a model that predicts the weather and explore the tools and libraries available for your own native Ruby Machine Learning projects.

    Whether you’re a seasoned Rubyist or just starting out, don’t miss this opportunity to discover the possibilities of machine learning in Ruby.

    RSpec is good, but it’s even better with less of it. We’ll first look through a heavily obfuscated real-world example, learning why parts of RSpec like let, subject, before, shared_examples, and behaves like can make your tests hard to read, difficult to navigate, and more complex. We’ll discuss when DRY is not worth the price. Then we’ll refactor some real open source RSpec code from Mastodon. In the end, we’ll look at what’s left. RSpec: The Good Parts.

    We all love shiny new tech and greenfield projects, but as software developers, we spend a lot of our time working with existing code. So let’s spend a few minutes talking about ways to improve the day-to-day developer experience of maintaining a Rails app. The examples and tools in this talk are specific to Ruby on Rails, but the ideas can apply to any stack. I will try to leave you with ten things that you can do tomorrow to make maintaining your application just a little easier.

    Ruby has always been a developer-friendly language, but that has often come at the expense of performance. The past several years have seen massive performance gains CRuby, JRuby, and TruffleRuby. Long-held assumptions about Ruby’s performance ceiling have been challenged and up-ended. In this talk, we’ll look at improvements in the virtual machine and the introduction of JIT compilers to better understand what’s making your Ruby code run fast(er).

    You’ve likely heard of Sorbet, a gradual type checker for Ruby. Using Sorbet, developers can harness the flexibility and creativity of a dynamic language like Ruby, while also benefitting from the safety of typing.

    However, in most apps, Sorbet will need some help type checking gem dependencies. This is the purpose of Tapioca, a gem that generates type signatures for other gems so they can be type checked by Sorbet.

    But how does Tapioca accomplish this? In this talk, we’ll dive into the tools and techniques used by Tapioca to reflect on Ruby code, and even walk through the process of building a new feature in the Tapioca codebase!

    Rubyists love the web, and it’s usually the primary platform for our applications. We tend to be highly pragmatic developers, choosing boring, well-tested technologies over what’s new and hot on Hacker News. Nowhere is this more evident than web3. Tasked with finding real use-cases for the federal government using these “decentralized” protocols and technologies, I’m here to tell you that in our — mostly justified — dismissal of web3, we are missing out on a pivotal innovation for user experience across the web: portable, verifiable, & interoperable digital identity.

    Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) are having a moment. Maybe you’ve heard a whisper in the corner about the jack-of-all trades Service Object, or a glimmering echo of advocacy for non-database-backed domain models? Think you’re using them right? Afraid you’re using them wrong? Then this is the talk for you! We’re going to explore the wonderful world of “convention plus choose-your-own configuration” of Rails codebases and the shining role of POROs (with their ride or dies, the Module). Come hear about the diversity of design patterns out in the wild so you too can confidently tell your coworkers “let’s just use a PORO for that”.

    Many of us are driven towards professional development and the next level, but what happens when the next level could be more than one thing? It could mean a promotion from mid-level to senior-level, taking on leadership responsibilities, or moving to a people-management role. What if we’re not sure which direction we want to go? In this talk, I’ll discuss ways you can move forward even when you haven’t decided on the trajectory yet. You'll walk away with tools and tactics you can utilize to pave and navigate your own path forward.
