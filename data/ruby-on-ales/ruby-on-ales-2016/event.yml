description: |-
  At the Tower Theatre in Bend, Oregon. Ruby on Ales is a two day single track Ruby conference in Oregon. It has all of the requisite makings of a conference—presentations, opportunities to find a new job and network—but let's be honest: Ruby on Ales feels a lot like a reunion of friends and colleagues.
