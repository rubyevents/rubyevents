- title: I Have No Idea What I’m Doing
  event_name: Scottish Ruby Conference 2014

  description:
    One day I found a note on my desk at home. I had no memory of writing
    it, but the handwriting was unmistakably mine. “I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING”,
    it said. In this talk I’ll confirm that I have no idea what I’m doing, and explain
    why that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

- title: State machines are everywhere! Let's face it.
  event_name: Scottish Ruby Conference 2014
  published_at: "TODO"
  description: 'State machines are everywhere. In fact the theoretical basis of our universe, quantum physics, consists of microscopic quantum state machines. These particles find themselves in discrete quantum states and can change state only in certain ways via uninterruptible transitions known as quantum leaps. Voila a perfect state machine.\n\nState machines control the phone call between you and your mother to ensure that you get connected when both of you pick up the phone at exactly the same time.\n\nState machines are paramount in the development of robust hypermedia API’s. The messages drive the application state (machine).\n\nIn general the state machine helps to simplify the logic to ensure your program responds appropriately in whatever order you throw events at it.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the powerful features of hierarchical state machines and look at how you can use them to accomplish simplexity in your programs.\n\nSimplexity: complexity wrapped in something simple.'
