    There is more to Ruby than Rails. But at the same time there is...less. This talk explores both useful and plain weird use cases for mruby and mruby/c. Starting with game scripting, going through retro consoles and finishing with auto-focus glasses. From the author of Ruby on Playstation with <3.

    Chris started programming as a kid on a Commodore 64 (which he still owns today). He enjoys working on web application performance and can often be found exploring APM tools to identify areas for optimization. He also has a strong interest in AI/ML workflows. Chris speaks just enough Japanese to hold a brief, two-minute conversation with Matz.

    Potionomics is a cozy game about running a potion shop and brewing potions. However, it can also lead down a deep rabbit hole of combinatorics, data modeling, and optimization. Join me in learning more about linear programming and how that can apply to fields from potion brewing to energy modeling.

    Youssef is an energy researcher turned software developer. Throughout his career, he has often worked on developer tools, drawn to the leverage they provide and the satisfaction of helping other developers become more productive.

    Rails includes a Dockerfile, but it can be optimized. Learn gem caching, layer strategies, multi-arch builds, and speeding up CI/CD. Use Docker effectively for development and production; it works for any Ruby app with or without Rails.

    Matti Paksula is a seasoned startup and end-to-end testing, DevOps, and hosting specialist who started using Ruby on Rails in 2006 and Docker in 2014. He has written numerous tools that he publishes to GitHub under the name matti.

    The Rubetta Stones were just uncovered in an archaeological dig near Helsinki. But they immediately started decaying when they were unearthed. Deciphering them seems impossible, but with the power of Ractors and a Ruby AI assistant, maybe we can break the code before it disappears forever.

    Louis is a Rails developer, song-parody writer, and committed punster. He started as an iOS developer but fell in love with Rails, TDD, and the joy of not having to wait for app store approval.

    Ruby's Booleans seem simple: just true and false, right? But under the hood and in practice, it's way messier. We'll talk about how Ruby interprets truth, why Booleans are often the wrong modeling tool, and how to model complex state the Ruby way.

    Sarah is a Senior Development Consultant at thoughtbot, former maintainer of Factory Bot, and has extensive experience maintaining and growing Ruby applications.
