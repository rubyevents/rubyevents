    Maintaining a young, small Ruby product is simple, but time passes and your code becomes harder to maintain day after day. This talk illustrates the development techniques, Ruby patterns and best practices we use at DNSimple to develop new features and ensure long-term maintainability of our codebase.

    You know HTTPS keeps your website secure but do you know how? Ruby just released a new version to address a vulnerability with SSL but do you know your app might still be vulnerable? Cryptography is a hard and huge topic and this talk will give you a great introduction. You don't need a background on cryptography, just an open mind! You will learn about the public key cryptography, SSL/TLS and Ruby tips that will make your app secure.

    Rails was born in 2004, the time of the "Ajax revolution". With the help of a little bit of prototype, Scriptaculous and RJS, Rails made its mark in part because it facilitated creating beautiful and highly interactive web user interfaces in no time at all. Fast forward to 2013. Frameworks like Meteor and Hoodie are capturing increasing mindshare. Are we now in the decade of JavaScript? Is the "Rails Way" still relevant to the frontend?

    In this talk we'll go through some concepts on the Ruby language that will help us creating our own custom Domain Specific Language. It's a very hands-on talk. We'll play with dynamic classes, dynamic methods, blocks, procs and method chaining, but our main goal is to write (and learn how) our own Pizza Menu DSL.

    Being tasked with rescuing an ancient codebase and turning it into something workable and manageable is a predicament most of us have already found ourselves in. In the 10 years since we began using Ruby to write Web applications, a lot has changed concerning architectures and design patterns. How do you take your code in a time travel from the olden days to more current practices such as POROs, lean models, presenters and decorators? This talk will walk you through some easy practices that can make that trip less bumpy and allow you to survive to tell the story.

    Rumor has it that you can't write concurrent programs in Ruby. People once believed that the world was flat and we all know how that turned out. Between the native threads introduced in MRI 1.9 and the JVM threading available to JRuby, Ruby is now a valid platform for concurrent applications. What we've been missing — until now — are the advanced concurrency tools available to other languages like Clojure, Scala, Erlang, and Go.

    The Ruby community has been bombarded by a plethora of discussions about software design best practices. Acronyms such as SOLID, DCI and SOA are up in the community and all them promise to materialize the ghost of maintainability. What few of these discussions present is that applying these principles and techniques fervently also impacts the software maintenance.

    In this talk I will present some of these concepts and show the symptoms that they can cause in yours projects if applied incorrectly.

    Organizing and structuring Rails applications has been an ongoing discussion for years in the community. While some find in necessary to introduce new abstraction layers, indirection and encapsulation for a sustainable architecture, others defend we shouldn't abandon the Rails Way for the sake of conventions and compatibility.

    In this panel both members from Rails core as well as the creator of Trailblazer are gonna discuss both approaches, their point of views, why they choose their way, and why they still can be friends.

    The fact that Ruby doesn't require developers to manage memory provides us a much less frustrating day-to-day. Still, there are scenarios where losing sight of the memory implications of our patterns and logic, will get us into trouble! In this talk, I'll go over common (and less common) memory pitfalls, how they work, and how to fix them.

    Rails is an awesome framework to build something fast from scratch, but when the app starts to grow it becomes harder to maintain if you keep following only the folders that Rails's initial configuration provides. There are a lot of approaches to get around it, Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture that separates the logic of the app from the delivery mechanism and from the database.

    Many people have difficulties to do a first contribution to open source, while others try to keep actively contributing. They do not feel confident enough, wondering if are doing it right, if they are following "patterns", if they will make mistakes in public, and this list of questions just keeps growing. This talk will attend the problems I've faced in the last years contributing and maintaining open source projects. It will give tips on how to start and remain active in today's open source world, and preserve your sanity to avoid the burnout.

    The Ruby community is known by its strong culture of testing, but this is not an excuse to refuse alternative approaches. One of these are Property Testing. In those tools we do not express examples, but the possible input formats; instead of specific outputs, characteristics that must remain true. In this way our tools are capable of exhaustively generate test cases and look for failures. In this talk we'll see how to create lean suites with wide coverage using Clojure's power to test a Rails application.

    Micro services are trend. It's a magic cure for complex projects. The problem is in the details! Like every trend topic, the problems and complications around this style are not discussed, topics like performance, scalability, integration tests and infrastructure. At this anti-talk we are going to show the traps lurking around micro services' architecture and how to avoid them.
