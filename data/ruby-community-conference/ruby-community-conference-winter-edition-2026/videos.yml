  title: "Workshop: From Code to Product: Build a Startup That Actually Works"
  description: |-
    Learn how to turn an idea into a startup that doesn't fail in the first year. Most technical founders skip the fundamentals - they build before validating, split equity badly, and ship products nobody wants. In this hands-on workshop, we'll cover the complete journey: validating ideas before writing code, building teams without destroying friendships, avoiding the traps that kill 90% of startups, and scoping an MVP that actually ships.

    Ever wondered how Large Language Models are actually built - from raw data to a talking model - but felt that most explanations stop at Python boilerplate?
    Good news: we're doing it in Ruby.
    In this hands-on workshop we'll build a real, working LLM from scratch, focusing on the pre-training phase. Using nanoGPT and torch.rb, we'll walk through the full pipeline: tokenization, model architecture, training loop, and finally running a model that mimics your own data.
