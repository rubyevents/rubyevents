  description: |-
    A continuation of the "Startups on Rails" series, this talk brings insights from conversations with ambitious new founders - including recent YC grads - who intentionally chose Ruby and Rails to move faster than their peers.

    Irina will explore:
    - Why new founders still bet on Rails in 2026
    - What Rails offers that competing stacks don't
    - What's missing (from modern frontend paths to AI patterns & tooling)
    - How the Rails ecosystem continues to evolve with Ruby 4.0 and new type systems
