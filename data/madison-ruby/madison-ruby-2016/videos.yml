  description: |-
    Have you ever run into that problem you are trying to solve, that is tangential to your core business? It's easy to run off, look for a gem, and use it. What is harder is when that gem isn't quite right. Maybe you should look for an alternative. Maybe you should fix the gem. Or if your problem is different enough, you can fork the gem. Or maybe you should just stop wasting so much time looking for the "easy" solution, and just DO THE WORK.
