    Refactoring is a daunting task. It’s hard to resist the urge to change
    all the things at once, and it’s easy to find yourself in an endless pit of data
    issues, bugs, and unhappy business owners. We’ll cover how to make changes safely
    and manage the inevitable complexities of phasing out legacy code.

  event_name: RubyConf Colombia 2017
  published_at: "2017-12-22"
  description:
    "t the 2014 RailsConf DHH declared system testing would be added to
    Rails. Three years later, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by introducing
    a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The feature brings system
    testing to Rails with zero application configuration by adding Capybara integration.
    After a demonstration of the new framework, we'll walk through what's uniquely
    involved with building OSS features & how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine.
    We'll take a rare look at what it takes to build a major feature for Rails, including
    goals, design decisions, & roadblocks."

  event_name: RubyConf Colombia 2017
  published_at: "2018-02-01"
  description:
    We will talk about implementing a compacting GC for MRI. This talk
    will cover compaction algorithms, along with implementation details, and challenges
    specific to MRI. Well cover low level and high level memory measurement tools,
    how to use them, and what they're telling us. We'll cover copy-on-write optimizations
    and how our GC impacts them. After this talk you should have a better understanding
    of how Ruby's memory management interacts with the system memory, how you can
    measure it, and how to adjust your application to work in concert with the system's
    memory.
