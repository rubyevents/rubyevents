    This talk is the conclusion of a journey I've been sharing throughout 2025. At RubyKaigi, I introduced Herb: a new HTML-aware ERB parser and tooling ecosystem. At RailsConf, I released developer tools built on Herb, including a formatter, linter, and language server, alongside a vision for modernizing and improving the Rails view layer.

    Now, I'll continue with ReActionView: a new ERB engine built on Herb, fully compatible with .html.erb but with HTML validation, better error feedback, reactive updates, and built-in tooling.

    This workshop peels back the layers of Ruby MRI to reveal what is really happening beneath the language's abstractions. Using Thread.new call as a starting point, the session dives deep into CRuby's internals - not with a high-level overview of concurrency models, but with a practical look at the underlying machinery in action.

    The entire execution path will be traced, beginning with a single line of Ruby code. The process will be followed as it's transformed into YARV bytecode, creates a native OS thread, and interacts with the VM's core scheduling components.

    Along the way, participants will gain an understanding of the functions that manage a thread's lifecycle and how Ruby interacts with the operating system behind the scenes. Modern observability tools will be used to make these internal processes visible. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have an intuitive mental model of how CRuby works.
