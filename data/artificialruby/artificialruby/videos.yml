    Demos:

    * Chris Power (aka: Typecraft): "AI Critiques Your Vim-fu" - What if AI could be more than an encyclopedia? At Typecraft, we merge bite-sized Vim challenges and deep-dive mini-courses to analyze every keystroke—evaluating your edits and coaching you on techniques you never knew (or have forgotten), making learning a true two-way street.
    * Keith Harper: "The future is here, and anyone can code it." - My experience as a designer working with AI to launch an MVP
    * Brian Fountain: "World Premier of 1000 Notes" - At the last meetup Scott challenged the community to build and share weird ideas, and Brian Fountain answered that call. You won't want to miss it!
