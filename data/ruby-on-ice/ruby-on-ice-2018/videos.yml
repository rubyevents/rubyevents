    Many Rubyists branch out and take a look at other languages. What are similarities between those languages and ruby? What are differences? How does Ruby influence these languages?

    Reusable, flexible code is often seen as the holy grail of software development. However, when new requirements come up, the code that was supposed to be reusable turns out to be too complex, difficult to understand, and not quite what is needed now. If that is the case, why do we continue to strive for reusability in the first place? This talk questions our tendency to generalize and our conviction that we can foresee what we’ll need in the future - and it’ll propose a different guiding principle instead.

    Programming history is filled with bugs that turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers to make even more interesting products. We’ll journey through code that was so ‘bad’ it was actually good. Along the way we'll look at the important role failure plays in learning. Then we’ll tame our inner perfectionists and tackle an approach to writing code that will help us fail spectacularly on our way to coding success.

    In 2017, Ruby is proven, almost boring technology. We use it mostly to build Backends for Hipster Technology™ JavaScript Frontends. But Ruby can do so much more - so let’s explore that. Ruby can paint pictures. Ruby can make music. As we will see: Ruby can be an engineer’s tool, or an artist’s tool.

    A practical introduction to SonicPI

    Sonic Pi is a creative music programming tool that enables anyone, no matter their musicality, to create music. And Ruby has been the lucky choice of programming language for it.

    In this entry-level workshop, you'll learn the basics of Sonic Pi, it's DSL and the tool itself. The majority of the time, however will be spent by you programming your own music. You'll learn some strategies, that enable you to get up to speed quickly and make you enjoy the ultra-fast feedback loop that is inherent in programming music with Sonic Pi.

    Machine learning by example

    Ruby has been mostly restricted to web development and scripting, until now. In this talk, I will introduce Tensorflow to the Ruby community to give them a glimpse of how they can do basic Machine Learning.

    We will start with the basic concepts of machine learning with Tensorflow, visualize our program with TensorBoard, following along the Python API and will get to know the Ruby API tensorflow.rb. Prior knowledge of Machine Learning or Tensorflow is not necessary. We will go through the workshop in a shared development environment, so you don't need to install or prepare anything on your laptop.

    Concurrency is an extremely powerful technique that should be part of every Rubyist's tool belt. But when a lot of people pick up tools such as puma, concurrent-ruby or even JRuby, they are at the same time thrilled by all the power that threads and concurrency gets them, and afraid for the day when a concurrency bug will come and chew their arm (or service) off.

    But what do we normally mean when we talk about a concurrency bug? What do they look like? And how do you fix them, preferably without giving up performance or readability? In this talk, I will show examples of Ruby patterns and techniques that lead to unsafe behavior in the presence of multi-threading, be it in MRI or JRuby. I will then discuss how they can be spotted, why they are problematic, and propose safe alternatives.

    A lot of the software we write is destined for deletion, yet one of the greatest drivers in humanity is the urge to be remembered. If we acknowledge the inevitability of this digital landfill what does this do to our definition of 'doing great work'?

    Is great work inherent to the code? Is it our customer's results? Is it the teams we build? Is it anything to do with the output in the first place?

    Everybody likes to work on the shiniest, newest stuff. But sometimes you have to maintain the existing legacy code that pays the bills.

    I have spent four years working on an app that exists as a standalone rails project since 2009. It has gone through major rails and ruby updates and innumerable gem updates, while being actively developed. Achieving a healthy balance is crucial to avoid collapse through technical debt.

    A systematic approach to software engineering management

    As engineers, we pride ourselves on building and continuously improving software systems that work. When it comes to organizing our teams and our working processes, though, we often leave this thinking at the door. In this talk, we'll look at the ways in which we can apply the mathematics of queues to design better ways to work together.

    Since Ruby 2.3 and the introduction of RubyVM::InstructionSequence::load_iseq, we've been able to programmatically load ruby bytecode. By divorcing the process of running YARV byte code from the process of compiling ruby code, we can take advantage of the strengths of the ruby virtual machine while simultaneously reaping the benefits of a compiler such as macros, type checking, and instruction sequence optimizations. This can make our ruby faster and more readable! This talk demonstrates how to integrate this into your own workflows and the exciting possibilities this enables.
