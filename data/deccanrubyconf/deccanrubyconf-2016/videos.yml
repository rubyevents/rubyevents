    Because Elixir and Phoenix borrow so many good ideas from the Rails ecosystem, it’s astoundingly easy for Ruby developers to become proficient in this powerful new set of tools. First, I’ll introduce Phoenix from a Rails POV, and then show two ways it can be used in conjunction with Rails.

    You likely use open source software every day: in your code, tools, and servers. But is it the stable foundation we expected? Let’s look at the strengths & weaknesses of open source and trade in our assumptions for a greater awareness. Together let’s shape a more sustainable open source ecosystem!

    Historically to handle multiple connections in Rails, you had to either patch active record or use a gem. Now, with some new apis on Rails 5.0, we can connect to multiple databases without needing any extra dependencies, and with just a few line of codes. And that will be even easier on Rails 5.1.

    I will be speaking on why caching is important and how we can scale up the Rails app using different caching strategies like page, action & fragment. I will also speak on how we can improve the performance in the simplest way by using instance variable caching for expensive command’s result.

    This workshop will be a gentle introduction to the concepts of infrastructure automation with Chef. We will work on writing as much code as we can, so that attendees can get comfortable with the practical aspects of using Chef. The goal at the end of the workshop would be to be able to deploy a Rails app to AWS using your own Chef recipes and community cookbooks.
