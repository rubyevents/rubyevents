    What started as a simple side project to find things to do in my city evolved into a full AI-powered event recommendation engine. I'll share how I've been building an intelligent event discovery platform in my spare time using Ruby.

    What would it take to recreate the magic of TikTok, snappy feeds, endless scroll, and smart recommendations, using only Ruby on Rails? This talk explores just how far Rails can go as a full-stack framework, from building modern UIs to experimenting with feed algorithms that keep content engaging.

    On December 22, 1978, veteran US Navy pilot Jay Prochnow found himself lost over the Pacific in a tiny single-engine plane after a navigation failure during a solo ferry flight. With no land in sight and nightfall approaching, he had to find a way to survive. This is the story of how he navigated out of the crisis—and what we can learn from his experience.

    This talk is the conclusion of a journey I've been sharing throughout 2025. At RubyKaigi, I introduced Herb: a new HTML-aware ERB parser and tooling ecosystem. At RailsConf, I released developer tools built on Herb, including a formatter, linter, and language server, alongside a vision for modernizing and improving the Rails view layer.

    Now, I'll continue with ReActionView: a new ERB engine built on Herb, fully compatible with `.html.erb` but with HTML validation, better error feedback, reactive updates, and built-in tooling.

    Tech as an industry is in a weird place right now. Far from being just for hobbyists, technology companies are the biggest companies in the world with market caps exceeding the GDP of many countries. Tech takes up an increasing amount of space in our lives while simultaneously becoming less fun than it once was.
