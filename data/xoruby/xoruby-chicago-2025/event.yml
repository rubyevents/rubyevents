description: |-
  Chicago has its own steady rhythm—each neighborhood with something different to offer. This event is for "locals" from St. Louis to Indianapolis who want to get together, learn something, and connect with others who are in search of the same.

  XO Ruby is a single-day, single-track conference designed to draw folks in from the city and the region. An approachable $100 ticket price coupled with no need for a hotel or airfare means you can connect with your community without breaking the bank.
