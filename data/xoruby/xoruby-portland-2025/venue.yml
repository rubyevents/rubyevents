name: "Bridge Space"
description: |-
  Close to the river in an up-and-coming part of town and steps away from one of Portland's newest food pods. This flexible space has been used by community and artist groups to host meetings, conferences, workshops, dances and more. The industrial chic space feels expansive, with a stage area set up at the far side of the space, kitchen and food prep spaces, and bathrooms.
