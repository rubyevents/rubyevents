    Learn how to build mobile apps the Rails way with Hotwire Native. By reusing your existing HTML and CSS, you can keep your business logic on the server and stay productive in Rails - without needing to become a mobile expert. Learn how small teams are shipping faster, solo developers are doing the impossible, and Rails is once again leading the way.

    A smart person learns from their mistakes; a wise person learns from the mistakes of others; How can we make a wise AI? I started with the question: can AI get an app from idea to working production deployment faster than I can? The answer was a resounding No. However, this has lead me to thinking about where the gaps are and how we could better load the context an AI needs to be successful at a more complex task. Join me in my experiments of leveling up our AI Ruby friends!

  description: |-
    Most of us treat our computers like magic, but under the hood they're just layers of simple logic stacked on top of each other. Using the Nand to Tetris curriculum, the Seattle.rb study group spent 12 weeks building a simulated computer entirely from the ground up—starting with a NAND gate, then constructing the hardware architecture, assembler, virtual machine, compiler, and even an operating system with games. In this talk, I will start with the nand gate, and build up a working computer explaining each layer as I go. You may not be able to build along with me in just a half hour, but I hope to infect you with my love for this curriculum and hopefully have it spread to your ruby/study group.

    Kent Beck wrote "Tests are the Programmer's Stone, transmuting fear into boredom."  But I keep encountering tests with nondeterministic behavior, so clearly not everyone got the memo... I'll talk about what a PRNG is, when you should absolutely use one in your test suite, when existing uses are safe to politely ignore, and when you should #KillItWithFire.  I'll also share an incredibly obvious realization about flaky tests that only took me several years to stumble into!
