    It’s no secret that AI is having a moment and engineering as we know it is rapidly changing. But, if you’re like me, you’re likely feeling a bit nervous about how quickly our industry is evolving.

    KOW offers insights into a topic he is an expert in: Failure. How to do it, how to avoid it, and what to do when you do fail. Failure isn't the end, and being aware of common failure methods will help you to avoid them.

    With a strong bias towards freelance work, but applicable to most effort driven endeavors, such as an agency, studio, or individual contributor, Karl offers lessons from his personal life about how to screw up, and how to avoid it. In the hopes that you may learn from his mistakes, and hopefully make some novel, unique mistakes all on your own.

    Finally KOW will also share a statement of intent to start or support a new Ruby Foundation in the efforts to diversify and strengthen the Ruby ecosystem. And some direct lessons on how to organize and strengthen community, an imperative effort.

- title: "Architecture"
  raw_title: "Architecture"
  event_name: "XO Ruby San Diego 2025"
  description: |-
    We use the term "architecture" in computer programming quite a bit. But is it a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)? What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings? We'll take a look at the history of patterns in building architecture, and how our industry adopted a similar way of thinking. What have we missed? Why do we only consider large architectural issues, and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural?
