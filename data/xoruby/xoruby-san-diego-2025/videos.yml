    Launching a Rails 8 app in two months as a single developer can sound scary. In this talk I will guide you through the choices made to deliver great value in time for a planned release. You will hear about the latest powers of Active Record, Active Job and Turbo 8. We will review system tests and take a look at Hotwire Native and Bridge components. You will learn why, twenty years after its release, Ruby on Rails is still the best single-developer web framework.

    It's no secret that AI is having a moment and engineering as we know it is rapidly changing. But, if you're like me, you're likely feeling a bit nervous about how quickly our industry is evolving. What should our response be to this cultural moment and how do we thrive in the midst of change? In this session, I will teach you the best way to respond, why being a unicorn is essential to your flourishing, and how to become one.

    KOW offers insights into a topic he is an expert in: Failure. How to do it, how to avoid it, and what to do when you do fail. Failure isn't the end, and being aware of common failure methods will help you to avoid them.

    With a strong bias towards freelance work, but applicable to most effort driven endeavors, such as an agency, studio, or individual contributor, Karl offers lessons from his personal life about how to screw up, and how to avoid it. In the hopes that you may learn from his mistakes, and hopefully make some novel, unique mistakes all on your own.

    Finally KOW will also share a statement of intent to start or support a new Ruby Foundation in the efforts to diversify and strengthen the Ruby ecosystem. And some direct lessons on how to organize and strengthen community, an imperative effort.

    We use the term "architecture" in computer programming quite a bit. But is it a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)? What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings? We'll take a look at the history of patterns in building architecture, and how our industry adopted a similar way of thinking. What have we missed? Why do we only consider large architectural issues, and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural?

    Nowadays, passwords are still our most common authentication method. However, they are not secure enough and have terrible UX.

    Therefore, big industry players in the FIDO Alliance like Google, Apple, Yubico, 1Password (among others) collaborated together to find a solution. WebAuthn was born and eventually became a W3C standard enabling users to authenticate on the web using public-key cryptography together with biometrics.

    This talk will allow you to learn what WebAuthn and Passkeys are and how they work. You'll also see how any Ruby app can easily get the level of authentication security and UX users deserve.
