    If your goal is building an online business, your tech stack doesn't really matter. There are so many other things you need to get right first, such as finding the right market, positioning effectively, and providing a great user experience. And as tech gets further commoditized, even more so with AI, your tech stack is going to matter even less. And when it does matter, Rails is good enough.
