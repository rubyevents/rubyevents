    I hear sometimes that good things come from carrots and sticks, from fear, from doing what you're told. But what if there's a better way to get the stuff we want? Stuff like money, working software, the geek joy of a solved problem. What if choosing love (and more specifically, curiosity, vulnerability, and kindness) gets us geeks what we want most?

    Realtime, rich client applications are extremely popular. This is reflected in a new generation of frameworks like node.js and meteor. That said, the maturity of Rails and Backbone combined with real time services like XMPP or Pushr, still makes it a very compelling backend stack to use, especially when developing cross platform (web, desktop, mobile) applications.

    In this talk, I will discuss the foundation and best practices of a Rails/Backbone/Coffeescript real time stack, as we do it at Kicksend.

    There is a shortage of software developers today. Programs like CodeAcademy, HungryAcademy and DaVinci Coders are looking to help with that shortage. Mike Gehard will lead a panel on learning, what are the strengths are weaknesses of these programs are and how we all can help alleviate the shortage of quality software developers. If you want to be part of the solution, please join us.

    For a long time, the de facto way of doing multi-core concurrency was using threads. However, the complexity of manipulating threads and state affected negatively how developers perceive concurrency. Fortunately, languages like Clojure and Erlang implement new paradigms that aim to make concurrency easier.

    In this talk, José Valim is going to discuss the role state play in concurrency and introduce different paradigms for multi-core concurrency, like Actors and Software Transactional Memory, explaining their trade-offs and why they matter to us developers.

    Software is always a mess. You can't avoid this mess, and if hubris goads you into attempting to achieve perfection, you'll just make things worse. Perfection is a distant, dim land on the unreachable horizon. You'll not be going there today.

    What you can do, however, is use the techniques of object-oriented design (OOD) to make your messes manageable. OOD is good at messes. It understands their origins, predicts their courses, and foresees their outcomes. It shines a light down the dusty nooks and crannies of your app, showing you what to do and what to avoid.

    This talk shows you how to use OOD to create the best kinds of messes, those that let you get software out the door today without regretting your actions tomorrow.
