    Bozhidar is the author of RuboCop and the editor of the community Ruby
    and Rails style guides. Most people would probably describe him as an Emacs zealot
    (and they would be right). He's also quite fond of the Lisp family of languages,
    functional programming in general and Clojure in particular. Believe it or not,
    Bozhidar has hobbies and interest outside the realm of computers, but we won’t
    bore with those here.
