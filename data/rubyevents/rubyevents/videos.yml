    Video of a conference talk about Saas on Rails on PostgreSQL presented by Andrew Atkinson at POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024. In this talk attendees will learn how Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL can be used to create scalable SaaS applications, focusing on schema and query design, and leveraging database capabilities. We’ll define SaaS concepts, B2B, B2C, and multi-tenancy. Although Rails doesn't natively support SaaS or multi-tenancy, solutions like Bullet Train and Jumpstart Rails can be used for common SaaS needs. Next we'll cover database designs from the Apartment and actsastenant gems which support multi-tenancy concepts, and connect their designs to Citus's row and schema sharding capabilities from version 12.0. We’ll also cover PostgreSQL's LIST partitioning and how to use it for efficient detachment of unneeded customer data. We'll cover the basics of leveraging Rails 6.1's Horizontal Sharding for database-per-tenant designs. Besides the benefits for each tool, limitations will be described so that attendees can make informed choices. Attendees will leave with a broad survey of building multi-tenant SaaS applications, having reviewed application level designs, database designs, to help them put these into action in their own applications.

    Andrew is a Staff Software Engineer who specializes in building high performance web applications using PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.

    Andrew wrote a book "High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails," published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024. Andrew has spoken previously at RailsConf, Sin City Ruby, PGDay Chicago, PGConf NYC, and RubyConf Argentina.

  event_name: "WasmCon 2024"
  date: "2024-09-10"
  description: |-
    Ruby on Rails is a famous “batteries included” framework for the rapid development of web applications. Its full-stack promise comes in a server-oriented, or HTML-over-the-Wire flavor: a server oversees everything from database interactions to your application UI/UX. And whenever there is a server involved, the network and its unpredictability come into play. No matter how much you enjoy developing with Rails, it would be hard to achieve the same level of user experience as with client-side and especially local-first frameworks. And here comes Wasm. With the help of WebAssembly, we can do a radical shift—bring the Rails application right into your browser, and make it local-first! In my talk, I want to discuss the challenges of making a classic web framework Wasm compatible, the techniques we can use to run server-first applications in the browsers and what are the use cases.

    Over the past 18 years, the JRuby team has worked to bring Ruby to the JVM, defying impossible challenges and building the most successful alternative Ruby implementation in the world. Today, JRuby is actively developed and deployed at thousands of Ruby and Java shops around the world... but how did we get here? This talk provides a retrospective of the JRuby project, with examples of modern JRuby usage along the way.

    Presented on August 19, 2023 at the Carolina Code Conference in Greenville, SC

  date: "2016-06-22"
  description: |-
    Almost every Rails database contains records that won't pass their model validations, leading to "can't happen" bugs months or years later. This talk introduces a gem that detects unsafe practices and lurking corrupt data. Learn to recognize and prevent five six ways data becomes corrupt, and maybe replace ActiveRecord validations entirely.
