    In recent years, Container technology has gradually became the mainstream choice of development and deployment. In the DevOps plan of 5xRuby software development, we have designed the best practice for packaging images with GitLab CI. In this speech, I will share how we containerize a Rails application and make a container image with the size of 100MB for Production Ready.

    Event driven concurrency is a feature of many modern programming languages, but until recently was difficult to use with Rub y. Ru by 3 includes a new fiber scheduler interface which allows us to hook into non-blocking operations and execute them concurrently, however robust implementations of this interface are not yet widely available. We will discuss the implementation of the Async fiber scheduler, how it works and how it can be used to build highly scalable applications.

    Rina is a chatbot game engine developed for CYBERSEC 2021 playground booth adventure game "1337 Operation".

    Related report:
    https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/144252

    We will release the source code for this project under MIT license alongside this talk.

    In the game "1337 Operation", the player is an FBI agent investigating a major ransomware attack. Though intelligence gathering & analysis, the player will identify the related hacking group, and the location of the suspect.

    At the finale, the player and other FBI agents will storm the residence of the suspect, using a micro bomb to break open the door and arrest the suspect.

    The whole process is captured by cameras, a fictional news clip would be automatically sent to the player as a souvenir.

    We've included various easter egg in the game. The player could check his/her process at the progress monitor on our booth, and compete with other players.

    In this talk, we will introduce various feature of Rina, e.g., context-aware dialogue, achievements, rankings, message speed adjustments and async external service integration.

    We will discuss our design and implementation. Using "1337 Operation" as our modal case, we will introduce how each feature could be utilized.

    Besides Rina, we will also share our experience on composing the story of the game, making interactive props, and how we connect physical devices with the game.

    We hope after our talk, you can also make your own real-life adventure game driven by chatbot, with ease."

    In recent years, Taiwan has attracted a lot of global companies due to political and economical reasons. We have also seen a surge of oversea entrepreneurs setting base here since the pandemic. This trend has put senior developers in high demand but short supply. Ruby Taiwan invites leaders of the PHP, Javascript and Java communities, who are also business owners themselves, to talk about how we as the developer community should face these challenges.

    When I write some code, I usually think about "can I do it better?" since my over 10 years of programming life. I use Ruby to write a simple LINE Bot with many Ruby language features to help me to find new movies as I need. Therefore I think about how can we use the "tricks" to let others feel the programming is very "simple" after we learned the programming skills. Let me show the programming tricks to you, it is not easy for everyone and needs a lot of practice and programming language knowledge, but it is not the reason to stop us.
