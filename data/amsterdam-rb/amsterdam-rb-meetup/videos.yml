    Howdy folks! ü§†

    We are back with a "real life" event!  Since this will be our first in-person event this year, we picked a venue with a view üåÖ.

    Zilverline will not just host our event, they will also provide us with food and drinks.

    It goes without saying that we have a great set of speakers again.

    In "Introduction to Ruby Fibers and the SchedulerInterface", Lars Vonk from Zilverline will kick off with his learnings on Ruby Fibers. Target audience: Junior - Senior level

    Our second speaker is Jonathan Boccara from Doctolib and will talk about testing principles. Spoiler: it's not about the testing pyramid nor measuring code coverage....

    Program:

    00:00 Start
    03:33 Opening, with Arno Fleming
    08:08 Lars Vonk - Introduction to Ruby Fibers and the SchedulerInterface
    41:28 Q&A with Lars
    50:18 Break time
    1:01:55 Jonathan Boccara - Thinking outside the (testing) pyramid
    1:42:12 Q&A with Jonathan
