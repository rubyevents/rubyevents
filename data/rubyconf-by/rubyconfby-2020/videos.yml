    Code visualization is an important part of coding. Usually, we use our imagination but what will happen if we ask ruby to do this work?

    In his talk, Anton will show a tool that we build in dry-rb and which exists only in the ruby ecosystem. This tool will help us to see all project component associations on the one page. You'll find out why other tools work terribly and how to visualize important things.

    Also, Anton explains how this visualization can help with onboarding new developers, find "god" objects in the system and use a heatmap of dependency usage for finding unused parts of the project.

    What is a transpiler? Isn't it something we use to make JavaScript less painful to work with? Sure, but not only that. Transpilers could be useful for other languages, too

    Find out how we can build a transpiler for Ruby, what "magic" is required to make edge Ruby syntax work in all Rubies, and why on Mars you might need it.
