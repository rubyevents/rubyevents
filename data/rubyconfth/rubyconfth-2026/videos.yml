    This talk presents what is the current problem with Rails apps from AI agents perspective. The lack of modularity in Rails apps make agents confused - the context is too big for them. The solution is making a big number of small modules with well defined interfaces.

    Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a technique which, together with event-driven and CQRS results in smaller modules.

    The app I am presenting has 50 small modules, composed via commands and events.

    I am also presenting an algorithm which helps reducing the size of ActiveRecord models - by gradually moving their responsibilities to read models and aggregates.

    Look at this repo to see the modularity mentioned - https://github.com/RailsEventStore/ecommerce

    There are a million tutorials out there showing you how to build a blog in Rails (in just 15 minutes!) and how to deploy that Rails app to some cloud provider (in just 5 minutes!), but what about after that first half-hour? When the guide says "this tutorial of course isn't production ready", what actually is production-ready? Let's talk about operating Rails apps in production.

    Your Rails app is in production. A user says it's slow. Another says a feature just broke. You need answers fast. This talk shows how to make your app observable: capturing metrics, logs, and traces, then feeding them into open source monitoring tools. You'll see what's worth recording, how to avoid drowning in noise, and how to set alerts that lead straight to the cause. Walk away ready to see inside your app when it matters most and fix problems before everything is on fire.
