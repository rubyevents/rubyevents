    We can use our skills to improve the lives of those around us, not just our employers and customers. In 2017 Nick's fianc√©e's surgeon told her that she would require a hip replacement. The surgeon remarked that barometric pressure very much affected day to day chronic pain. He decided to test this.

    Using a Twilio SMS 'front end', Ruby on Rails 'back end', and WeatherUnderground integration Nick promptly built an application to randomly request her pain levels against local barometric pressure for four months and processed the results. The processing involved his first foray into machine learning concepts with Ruby. This talk will tell their story, walk through the exact code as it was executed, and elaborate on our responsibility to 'give back' to those around us with our Ruby 'superpower'.
