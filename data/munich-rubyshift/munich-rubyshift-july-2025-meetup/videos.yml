    Dear Munich Rubyists,

    Summer's coming and so is our July meetup!

    We're looking for a company to provide a location and food & drinks -- so if your company wants to host this edition of our meetup, please get in touch. We're also looking for 1 or 2 speakers -- so if you're up for a talk or know somebody who is, please let me know.

    On a personal note: As I've said before, this event will be the last one that I'm organizing. It's time to pass on the baton to someone who's still (more) active in the Ruby ecosystem -- so if you're willing to step up, drop me a line or talk to me at the meetup.

    Looking forward to seeing you all in July!

        Complex data filtering in Rails often leads us down a rabbit hole of custom scopes, service objects, and Arel acrobatics. But what if we let the database do what it’s best at? In this talk, you’ll see how SQL views paired with plain ActiveRecord and Ransack can turn messy logic into elegant, powerful queries — without giving up the Rails way.

        About our speaker:
        Clemens Helm is a seasoned Rails developer from Vienna who believes good code is boring — in the best way. At railscraft.de, he helps teams modernize legacy Rails apps with clean architecture, sharp tools, and zero-nonsense pragmatism.
