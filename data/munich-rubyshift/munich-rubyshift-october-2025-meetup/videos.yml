    Dear Munich Rubyists,

    will be nice to see you all again on 16.10.

    The meetup will take place at Lanes & Planes GmbH and the food is sponsored by Ruby Central.

    We have two interesting talks. One from Chikahiro "Is the monolith a problem?" and another from Klaus - "A resource-oriented file structure for Rails".

    On a personal note: This is the first event that I am organizing since I took over the group from Clemens. If anyone wants to help organize it or become a co-organizer of the group, please contact me.

    Discord group: https://discord.gg/EKqHWmCxGZ

    Looking forward to seeing you all in October!
