    Dear Rubyists,

    our first Meetup in 2026 will take place on January 22nd in **AUGSBURG !!!**

    After opening its gates at Rails World 2025 in Amsterdam, the Ruby embassy (a "fun bureaucratic activity") is opening a branch office at our local Meetup group. Take a photo, fill out your application forms, grab your Ruby passport and start collecting stamps.

    The Ruby embassy will also issue passports at our future Meetups, although potentially with less bureaucracy (i.e. less fun).

    More details about the Ruby passport: https://therubypassport.notion.site

    After food & drinks we'll switch over to some talks.

    CALL FOR SPEAKERS:
    - We are still looking for a second talk. Please contact me if you have something in mind.

    Looking forward to seeing you all in January!
