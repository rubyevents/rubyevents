    Dear Munich Rubyists,

    Summer's coming and so is our July meetup!
    
    We're looking for a company to provide a location and food & drinks -- so if your company wants to host this edition of our meetup, please get in touch. We're also looking for 1 or 2 speakers -- so if you're up for a talk or know somebody who is, please let me know.
    
    On a personal note: As I've said before, this event will be the last one that I'm organizing. It's time to pass on the baton to someone who's still (more) active in the Ruby ecosystem -- so if you're willing to step up, drop me a line or talk to me at the meetup.
    
    Looking forward to seeing you all in July!

        Complex data filtering in Rails often leads us down a rabbit hole of custom scopes, service objects, and Arel acrobatics. But what if we let the database do what it’s best at? In this talk, you’ll see how SQL views paired with plain ActiveRecord and Ransack can turn messy logic into elegant, powerful queries — without giving up the Rails way.

        About our speaker:
        Clemens Helm is a seasoned Rails developer from Vienna who believes good code is boring — in the best way. At railscraft.de, he helps teams modernize legacy Rails apps with clean architecture, sharp tools, and zero-nonsense pragmatism.

    Dear Munich Rubyists,

    will be nice to see you all again on 16.10.
    
    The meetup will take place at Lanes & Planes GmbH and the food is sponsored by Ruby Central.
    
    We have two interesting talks. One from Chikahiro "Is the monolith a problem?" and another from Klaus - "A resource-oriented file structure for Rails".
    
    On a personal note: This is the first event that I am organizing since I took over the group from Clemens. If anyone wants to help organize it or become a co-organizer of the group, please contact me.

    Looking forward to seeing you all in October!

    Dear Rubyists,
    
    our first Meetup in 2026 will take place on January 22nd in **AUGSBURG !!!**
    
    After opening its gates at Rails World 2025 in Amsterdam, the Ruby embassy (a "fun bureaucratic activity") is opening a branch office at our local Meetup group. Take a photo, fill out your application forms, grab your Ruby passport and start collecting stamps.
    
    The Ruby embassy will also issue passports at our future Meetups, although potentially with less bureaucracy (i.e. less fun).
    
    More details about the Ruby passport: https://therubypassport.notion.site
    
    After food & drinks we'll switch over to some talks.
    
    CALL FOR SPEAKERS:
    - We are still looking for a second talk. Please contact me if you have something in mind.
    
    Looking forward to seeing you all in January!
