    This talk is the conclusion of a journey I've been sharing throughout 2025. At RubyKaigi, I introduced Herb: a new HTML-aware ERB parser and tooling ecosystem. At RailsConf, I released developer tools built on Herb, including a formatter, linter, and language server, alongside a vision for modernizing and improving the Rails view layer.

    Successful Rails apps tend to become massive monoliths over time. Our's is no exception. Our team is over 1000 engineers. Our codebase is over 4 million lines of Ruby.

    But, Rails doesn't tell you how to manage that many developers working on that large a codebase. So, we're encouraging modularization and boundaries within our codebase. Our approach is lightweight and actually producing results.

    We're the right ones to talk about this because we're the one's issuing the guidance internally.

    Real-time collaboration is a powerful tool for web apps, but difficult to implement. Most Ruby developers lack CRDT exposure and collaborative software challenges like conflict resolution and distributed consistency. This talk shows how to leverage Rails while adding sophisticated collaborative features using AnyCable to boost ActionCable performance and Yjs to simplify collaborative editing.

    I've specifically been implementing this approach in a production Rails setting, giving me a solid perspective on the challenges involved.

    New developers face months of unproductive confusion when dropped into massive codebases they can't navigate or understand. What if they could get instant answers about how systems work, identify what code needs changing, and understand complex business logic without waiting for help? This talk demonstrates how Rails' built-in introspection transforms into expert AI tools that understand your specific codebase, making institutional knowledge accessible 24/7. Instead of 3-month ramp-ups, developers contribute meaningfully in days while the entire team stays productive.

    Inertia.js solves a huge pain point for server side MVC frameworks: clean integration with rich client-side libraries like React, Vue, and Svelte. Inertia Rails allows both sides of this equation to shine. The Rails code looks almost exactly like vanilla Rails code (without the view layer), which keeps existing Rails teams productive. On the client, Inertia Rails takes away a lot of the headaches in gluing React and Rails together: session based auth, server side global state management, and Inertia form submissions make life much easier on teams.

    We are writing our Ruby code wrongly. We're using classes as the unit of design; we needn't, and we shouldn't. We use design patterns as recipes; they're largely irrelevant. We come up with arcane project structures and convoluted deployment systems; we needn't.

    For the last half-decade, I've been writing Ruby very differently to my previous style. Almost no classes. Creating structure as it grows, rather than before I start. Drastically cutting down dependencies. The result: my code seems drastically easier to write, maintain, and reuse.

    I'd like the opportunity the spread the word.

    MCP is still pretty foggy for most developers, and Ruby shouldn't be left out of the AI tooling party. This story shows how a simple "let me figure this out" project can accidentally become something fun and interesting to share. I've been learning about MCP, from the official ruby SDK, and stumbled onto this idea of self-generating UI interfaces. If you've ever stared a new project and wondered "how do I even start?", this talk is one example from foggy confusion to sunshine moment of "holy smokes, I didn't know that was possible." Besides, Ruby deserves a seat at the AI table.
