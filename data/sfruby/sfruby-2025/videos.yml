    At RubyKaigi, Marco introduced Herb, a new HTML-aware ERB parser and tooling ecosystem. At RailsConf, he released developer tools built on Herb, which included a formatter, linter, and language server. There, he also shared a vision for modernizing the Rails view layer. This talk concludes his 2025 journey on the topic.

    Successful Rails apps tend to become massive monoliths over time. Our's is no exception. Our team is over 1000 engineers. Our codebase is over 4 million lines of Ruby.

    But, Rails doesn't tell you how to manage that many developers working on that large a codebase. So, we're encouraging modularization and boundaries within our codebase. Our approach is lightweight and actually producing results.

    We're the right ones to talk about this because we're the one's issuing the guidance internally.

    New developers face months of unproductive confusion when dropped into massive codebases they can't navigate or understand. What if they could get instant answers about how systems work, identify what code needs changing, and understand complex business logic without waiting for help? This talk demonstrates how Rails' built-in introspection transforms into expert AI tools that understand your specific codebase, making institutional knowledge accessible 24/7. Instead of 3-month ramp-ups, developers contribute meaningfully in days while the entire team stays productive.

    This talk matters because we are enduring death by a thousand quiet cuts. The world asks us to go faster while our spirits beg us to slow down. Emotional exhaustion has become the norm, but it doesn't have to be. I built Peace of Mind not just with Rails, but with urgency and heart. As a newer dev and RailsConf Scholar, I've lived the tension between burnout and beauty. Choosing peace...in our work, our lives, and our code creates ripples. It starts with one. One you. One me.

    Inertia.js solves a huge pain point for server side MVC frameworks: clean integration with rich client-side libraries like React, Vue, and Svelte. Inertia Rails allows both sides of this equation to shine. The Rails code looks almost exactly like vanilla Rails code (without the view layer), which keeps existing Rails teams productive. On the client, Inertia Rails takes away a lot of the headaches in gluing React and Rails together: session based auth, server side global state management, and Inertia form submissions make life much easier on teams.

    David Thomas is a legend of the Ruby community and the Agile software development movement, an author of numerous books on Ruby and Rails, and the founder of the Pragmatic Bookshelf. In this talk, he argues that we are writing Ruby code the wrong way. We use classes as the unit of design when we don't need them and shouldn't rely on them. We also treat design patterns as recipes, which makes them largely irrelevant. Finally, we create arcane project structures and convoluted deployment systems that we simply do not need.

    MCP is still pretty foggy for most developers, and Ruby shouldn't be left out of the AI tooling party. This story shows how a simple "let me figure this out" project can accidentally become something fun and interesting to share. I've been learning about MCP, from the official ruby SDK, and stumbled onto this idea of self-generating UI interfaces. If you've ever stared a new project and wondered "how do I even start?", this talk is one example from foggy confusion to sunshine moment of "holy smokes, I didn't know that was possible." Besides, Ruby deserves a seat at the AI table.

    Carmine believes the merchants of complexity have sold the AI world a lie. They claim you need their frameworks, SDKs, and enterprise architectures. He argues that today's AI is mostly API calls, and when the challenge shifts from training models to building products, complexity becomes a liability and simplicity becomes everything. Rails proved that lesson before.

    Meet Carmine Paolino and learn about the design decisions behind one of the most popular new Ruby open-source projects: RubyLLM.

    "One API for every model, every vendor. One developer on one machine serving thousands. While Python developers debug their 14-line 'Hello World,' we're shipping. Ruby's time in AI isn't coming. It's here."

    Running a web service requires you to do so many things that aren't included in any programming books or tutorials. We need more developers able to ship services that work, rather than expecting each developer to figure out the entire list by trial and error, one at a time, by themselves. Blog posts with individual tips about isolated problems don't cut it either, because no one is creating a field survey or a checklist of the overall process and making sure developers are aware of and ready for what they'll face in production.

    There's a ton of untapped potential in Rails and other gem source for upskilling that teams aren't leveraging because they don't know how. And there's almost no content showing how.

    This problem hurts Ruby open source, because teams don't know how to contribute or make gems (exposure to real open source code is the first step IMO).

    I've given several Rails source deep-dive workshops over Zoom that 70+ people have attended. I've shown a live-demo of this on stage at RailsConf that attendees raved about.

    In this presentation, Jeremy Evans, author of Roda and Sequel, the book Polished Ruby Programming, and Principal Engineer at Ubicloud, shares a new approach to CLI development. Instead of parsing command-line arguments in the client, arguments are sent to an endpoint. He discusses the pros and cons of this approach, the development of a new argument-parsing library, cross-compiling CLI programs, and how this design enables using a CLI without installation by integrating it into a web application.

    Ruby developers, like all developers, are nervous about their worth in an AI-first world. This talk offers reason for optimism by sharing a perspective on using AI to enhance roles rather than replace them.

    For over ten years, Sarah has spoken, written, and thought deeply about software design. Over the last six months, she has worked with code assistants to explore what they can do in real Rails codebases, not new projects or toy apps.

    As Rails developers, we develop on the shoulders of giants. We can do what we can do because of the work of thousands of open source contributors; I want to encourage more developers to give back through open sourcing their work.

    This also isn't a subject talked about often and having just taken a codebase from open to closed source, I can offer a unique perspective. I remember struggling with a lack of resources of the subject when we started the project. Hopefully this talk can make it easier for the next person who open sources their codebase.
