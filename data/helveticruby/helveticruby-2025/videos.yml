    We will build a fully functional Kanban board application with Rails and Hotwire. During the workshops, you will gain hands-on experience in using Hotwire: Turbo Drive and Frames, Turbo Streams with broadcasting, and Stimulus controllers fundamentals. More importantly, we will thoroughly explain the core concepts of Hotwire, giving you the knowledge and tools to build dynamic and modern applications with Rails.

    The workshop session consists of short theoretical introductions with practical examples and tasks to implement. We will progressively improve the existing application by making it more dynamic and usable with Hotwire.

    The workshop is ideal for those who have already heard about Hotwire, but didn‚Äôt have a chance to write a serious app with it! But if you know nothing - don‚Äôt worry, before each task, we will explain the theory. We promise to give you an inspiration to use the benefits of Hotwire whenever possible!

    How‚Äôs your approach to software design doing? Do you get to feel creative? Do you get to use that creativity to build a shared understanding with your team and arrive at simpler code? You can with riffing! Riffing is a new approach that‚Äôs easy to pick up & can take you to the next level in your career.

    When riffing we take full advantage of Ruby being a language, we use Ruby to speak and then program our mental model directly. We explore designs to get rapid feedback and then raise issues early. Riffing is really useful to derisk what we‚Äôre working on, ultimately leading to better communication and healthier codebases.

    Can someone write a large quantity of high-quality code? Yes! The idea that speed sacrifices quality is a myth. The key lies in gathering ample feedback‚Äîboth internal and external. Shifting focus to feedback quantity, while still prioritizing quality, enables consistent high-quality code. This talk explores supporting research and practical ways to gather feedback effectively.

    What if writing code and creating art aren‚Äôt as different as we think? From the blank canvas to the final product, both artists and coders follow a journey of exploration and iteration. Join us as we uncover the surprising similarities between the worlds of painting and programming‚Äîhow creativity, rules, and tools shape both crafts. Could the same principles that guide an artist also guide a developer?
