        Some time ago I stumbled across the header description for WAV files
        and wondered, what if I took a file and calculated the appropriate WAV
        file header for it, could I _hear_ my data?  Yes, you can.  You probably
        don't want to, but you can.  You can do something similar with BMP and

        report about code quality. You can run it locally to view how your
        project is doing and what are the smelly spots. A way of getting sense
        of how your code quality is evolving over time is by setting it up on
        your CI and storing the reports artefacts.

        What does it mean to make a system observable? Too often this is translated
        into simply installing technical tools to measure low-level concerns like
        memory, CPU or background queues size. In this talk, I will present the

        Email has been around for a long time, predating even the Internet, and
        despite the best efforts of big tech to monopolise our communications,
        it's still the most popular way to for people to communicate online.
        This ubiquity means it's a really easy wayf or Government to keep in
        touch with us, but email is a tricky thing to manage, running
        mailservers can be a faff, and email as a service solutions can be
        expensive. In this talk I'll go through a potted history of email, talk
        about a tool that the Government Digital Service have developed to make
        email easier for goverment agencies, and a Ruby gem I've build to make
        it even easier for Rails devs.

        We all know how valuable it is to keep the quality of your code high. Working on a high quality codebase is more enjoyable and enables us to deliver value much more effectively for our users and yet, time and again I hear engineers saying, “I am not allowed to spend sufficient time on code quality”.

        This talk clarifies the value of maintaining a high quality codebase, gives you guidance on how to talk about this to help you get the support of your colleagues and managers for spending time on this and also outlines some key practices that will help you achieve this.

        Sonic Pi's an open source Ruby code-based music creation and performance tool.

        Rob's presenting a few experiments in Sonic Pi, covering oddities such as:

        * negative melody
        * Jianpu (numbered musical notation)
        * just intonation
        * microtonal music - 19 EDO (Equal Division of the Octave)
        * interfacing with MIDI controllers over USB and bluetooth BLE.

        Also Rob will walk us through a memory management improvement PR to Sonic Pi - that may have made it into the release.

        My company (Trapeze) specialises in public transport including schedule

        travelling salesman problem and of the general problem of optimising
        pickup and drop-offs in demand responsive public transport. This talk
        will compare implementing a Hamiltonian curve finder in a number of
        different languages. The talk looks both at the speed of the language
        and the elegance. For Ruby, I compare a couple of different
        implementations. Other languages that are compared are Elixir, Go,
        Javascript, Java, C++, C# and Python.

        The source code is in a public Github repository details of which I will

        In combination with `bundle open` to insert breakpoints into the code of
        gems being used in your stack, debugging can expose really tricky
        dependency bugs, as I aim to demonstrate with one that I found in the

        Today Agile is the default choice for software development out there. Every
        conference, book, or blog post is telling us we are doomed to fail if we
        don’t follow this established convention. But isn't it surprising to think
        that Agile is advocated as the right methodology for every possible company
        doing software out there? Are we going to organize software development
        exactly the same way if we are working for a startup, NASA, or FedEx? It
        seems hard to believe. In this presentation, I will explore the mental
        model to help you choose when you should (or sometimes should not) use
        Agile using the lenses of risk management. My goal is to provide guidance
        for the puzzled business owner, project manager, or software developer who
        wants to pick what's right for their company or team.

        What makes a senior engineer? What other aspects of
        being a senior engineer are as important, if not more important, than
        knowing a programming language inside out. What things can you work on to
        become or be a better senior engineer (that won't have a new framework out
        by next week!). This is a set of lessons learned in a journey from self
        taught front end developer to senior polyglot developer (via ruby).

        Working with XSLT/XPath’s XDM type system in Ruby requires learning how to
        translate between two very different type systems in a way which allows for
        idiomatic Ruby without ignoring the bits of XDM which aren’t quite Ruby-shaped.
        Oh, and the only open-source implementation is in Java, so Java’s type system is
        in the mix.

        I’ll look at a couple of cases where the different approaches and
        assumptions of Ruby and XDM (and Java, which just can’t help sticking
        its nose in) interact in an interesting way.

        Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and
        misusing Git can cost development teams time, energy, and money. Few
        better examples exist than Git's default merge workflow which creates
        repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this
        talk, I'll show how to use the [Git Rebase
        Workflow](https://www.alchemists.io/articles/git_rebase) instead,
        which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code that's easy to

        You may have heard that cookie security is hard with the need to worry
        special flags and encryption. Actually, Ruby on Rails makes it super
        simple to securely store data in cookies. In this talk I'll explain the
        different types of cookies supported by Rails and what Rails does under
        the hood to secure the data they contain.

        Sometimes a new feature may be objectively worthwhile; but often one
        might be left wondering “Does this actually make our product better?”,
        or “Is this making the business more money?”.

        In this talk, I will explore the virtues of defining North Star metrics,
        AB testing product variations to statistical significance, and using
        funnel analysis to quantify a feature's value.

        One of the aspects of Ruby & Rails that gives it the reputation for not

        enforce modularity. Over time and with many developers this usually
        leads to 'spaghetti code'. This talk will introduce a solution to this

        It's often considered best practice to normalize the database structure
        to avoid data redundancy and incoherence. In Pennylane's accounting
        platform we've found that this actually does not always help with data
        coherence, and even introduces additional complexity in managing data
        access. Our combination of denormalizing some of our data, enhancing
        some of ActiveRecord's methods, and introducing default behaviors in our
        application models has enabled us to greatly simplify access control
        management and given us confidence that our production data is in a
        consistent state.

        As services start to split off from your majestic monolith, cascading

        Implementing load-shedding and deadline propagation across your services
        is a technique which can help you provide a more resilient service to
        your customers. This talk will introduce some of the concepts explored

        Understanding our applications' performance can be tricky. Some of the readily available performance tools introduce a big overhead which makes them not suitable for use in production environments, where in many cases, it's the best place to troubleshoot performance issues.

        [rbperf](https://github.com/javierhonduco/rbperf/) is a low-overhead on-CPU profiler and tracer that is suitable for usage in production environments. It doesn't require the application under investigation to be restarted or disturbed in any way.

        We will discuss some of the tradeoffs in its design, its architecture, the features that make it unique, as well as its limitations compared to other tools. We will also take a look at how the Ruby stack is laid out in memory and the role BPF plays in rbperf.

        That strange phenomenon where air molecules bounce against each other in a way that somehow comforts you, makes you cry, or makes you dance all night: music. Since the advent of recorded audio, a musician doesn't even need to be present anymore for this to happen (which makes putting "I will always love you" on repeat a little less awkward).

        Musicians and sound engineers have found many ways of creating music, and making music sound good when played from a record. Some of their methods have become industry staples used on every recording released today.

        Let's look at what they do and reproduce some of their methods in Ruby!

        In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappi’s data history and how
        we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique
        data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data
        set and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory
        index.

        We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our
        data, connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query
        layer was used to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able
        to interrogate our entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.

        In this talk, I will demonstrate 3 powerful debugging techniques using Ruby's new debugger [`ruby/debug`](https://github.com/ruby/debug):

        * Step-debugging
        * Frame navigation
        * Breakpoint commands

        By using them together, we can reduce unnecessary context switching and make our debugging sessions more efficient. You will also learn more about `ruby/debug` while we walk through these techniques with its commands and console.

        And finally, I will show you how to level up our productivity even further by automating debugging steps using `ruby/debug`'s scriptable breakpoints.

        When talking about performance, most developers think application speed,
        faster algorithms or better data structures. But what about your test
        suite? CI time is developer waiting time!

        At Shopify we have more than 170,000 Ruby tests and we add 30,000 more
        annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth requires some
        aggressive methods. We will illustrate some of our techniques including
        monitoring, test selection, timeouts and the 80/20 rule. If you have
        experience in writing tests and want to learn tricks on how to speed up
        your test suite, this talk is for you!

        In this talk I'll teach you some of the details about how the Ruby
        interpreter manages memory. I'll introduce a project my team and I are
        working on that aims to make Ruby faster by improving its memory
        efficiency, and then we'll talk about how our implementation broke
        Garbage Collection.

        After that we'll go on a journey together, through some weeds, and

        Like most web applications, you run important jobs in the background. And
        today, some of your urgent jobs are running late. Again. No matter how many
        changes you make to how you enqueue and run your jobs, the problem keeps
        happening. The good news is you're not alone. Most teams struggle with this
        problem, try more or less the same solutions, and have roughly the same
        result. In the end, it all boils down to one thing: keeping latency low. In
        this talk I will present a latency-focused approach to managing your queues
        reliably, keeping your jobs flowing and your users happy.

        We'll start with a simple Ruby Kata and solve it together, live, with
        imperative programming.

        We'll then fix the many, many, many things we got wrong. Then we'll solve
        the problem again using patterns from functional programming. You'll leave
        this talk with a clear and concrete example of why functional programming
        matters, why immutable code matters, and why it can help you writing
        bug-free code.

        The next time you find yourself writing imperative code, you might
        consider... the functional alternative.

        Everywhere you look, stories surround us, and everyone has something that’s worth sharing with others. As speakers, we need to understand how to structure our talks so they can have the best effect on the audiences we are trying to reach. How do you discover the right angle and the right story for a talk? How do you frame your story?

        Within tech we know how to approach building a new product: we research our user base, we figure out what and for who we’re trying to create something for and we make sure we constantly iterate on what we’ve come up with. So why aren’t we taking the same approach for our talks?

        This talk will examine how to get in the right mindset of examining your talk ideas, and will introduce a framework of how to design and iterate on your talk. It will focus on several exercises and questions to help you create the best talk for the story you’re trying to tell.

        > The simplest way of running tests is to run all of them, regardless of what changes you are testing. However, depending on the size of your test suite, this will either get slow or expensive. At Shopify we have almost 300,000 Rails tests and we add 50,000 more annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth makes it impossible to run all tests, all the time! Hence we implemented a framework to only run tests relevant to your code changes.
        >
        > We will build a test selection framework from scratch in this workshop. We will begin by exploring the fundamentals of such a framework: code analysis. After that we will dive into minitest reporters, how they work and how we can use them to generate a test map. Finally we will use the generated test map to only run tests relevant to your code changes. Attendees will walk away with a solid understanding of what test selection is, how it works and how to implement it.

        This is a workshop, so bring your laptop!

        What comes after cloud computing? Cloud computing is convenient,
        ubiquitous and relatively cheap. But it also locks developers into proprietary
        solutions that make migrating to another provider or bringing your solutions
        back in-house difficult and expensive. If AWS, Google Cloud Computing, Azure
        and all the others are clouds, then we also need a sky. Researchers at Berkeley
        and other institutions have proposed sky computing: an interoperability layer
        that removes technological lock-in and enables multi cloud application development.'

        share our adventure of moving some Kafka infrastructure code from the main
        Rails app into a local gem (with zero downtime!). Think of it as giving the
        code a new home where it can be shared across our Rails Engines. We've also

        This presentation will be about the challenges of building large
        Ruby web applications and how to maintain existing ones. I will use examples
        adapted from real applications that I worked on during my 10 years of experience
        with Ruby outlining: technical limitations of the language, how to use a modular
        dependency structure to enforce boundaries in complex domains.'

        In this talk, I will present a methodology for replicating most standard
        Rails systems, for the purpose of load testing.

        You can use this to find out how your system performs with more traffic than
        you currently encounter. This will be useful if you are on a Rails team that
        is starting to see scaling challenges.

        At Theta Lake we operate at scale and are applying this methodology to
        proactively find ways to bring down our server costs. You don’t want to leave
        it until either your server costs soar out of control, or your entire system
        is about to fail. By seeing into the future just a little bit, you can find
        bottlenecks in your system and so find where you can improve its scalability.

        A review on what makes OOP such an effective paradigm to work in,
        followed by a critical discussion on some of the newer design trends in
        the Ruby space. We will discuss the concerns of relying too heavily on
        these patterns, and alternative approaches.

        In this talk, I recount and discuss how I refactored some legacy ruby
        code using the Simple Design Dynamo and ideas from "Tidy First" to make
        it more agile, and then, using Domain-Driven Design, take that agility
        to the next level.

        For years, React has been the go-to choice for building frontend applications
        — but is it always the best solution? In this talk, I’ll share my journey from
        working extensively with React to discovering Hotwire, a radically different
        approach that enables dynamic applications without heavy JavaScript or complex
        state management.

        Rather than a theoretical comparison, I’ll walk through real-world examples,
        demonstrating how I’ve implemented interactive features using Hotwire. I’ll
        also discuss my experiences, the challenges I faced, and some surprising
        discoveries along the way.

        AI has many applications in our industry, we are just getting started.

        In this talk, I'll explore an approach to AI-powered observability
        tooling that knows everything about you and your codebase.

        I'll demo some of the most recent tooling in AI-assisted development,
        show you how to enrich an LLM with highly relevant contextual information and
        display a little workflow that shows how to use AI to fix bugs faster as
        they happen in production.

        Lately, there has been a lot of development in durable workflows in
        Rails with tools like `active_job_continuation` and `acidic_job`.
        [`stepper_motor`](https://github.com/stepper-motor/stepper_motor) is a
        new tool allowing for identifiable, associable, orchestrated step
        workflows for Rails applications - without gRPC, extra tools or data
        stores. Let's explore where such a system comes from, why every durable
        execution system is secretly a DAG, and how the `stepper_motor`
        architecture is informed by VFX software instead of the imperative
        `ActiveJob` methods.
