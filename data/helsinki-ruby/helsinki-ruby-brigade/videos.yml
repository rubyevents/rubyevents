        Like many other problems in coding, localization (the art of making your stuff usable and nice to people from various countries and cultures) can seem really easy, until it’s not. Really simple solutions often get you most of the way to what you need, but then the final few complexities turn out to be Hard. I’ve spent a decade working on making localization easier; let me share with you a couple of the projects I’m currently engaged in, and how you can help make the world a little bit more international.

    Welcome to the Helsinki Ruby Brigade summer kick-off and after work drinks!

    This is going to be a very casual event for meeting other Ruby folks. No talks nor any other official programming. Just come along to have a chat about Ruby stuff!

    The location for this event is the Rotterdam terrace in Kamppi. In addition to drinks, they should also have smash burgers available for purchase. Look for Rubies, the Ruby Brigade logo, and other telltale signs of software engineers.

    This event doesn't have a sponsor.

    ⚠️ Note: depending on the weather and availability, we may need to move the event indoors or to another nearby location. Keep an eye on this page to make sure you navigate to the right place.

    Welcome to the first meet-up of 2025, this time generously hosted by Kisko Labs.

    Programme:
    * Drinks & snacks
    * Ruby pub quiz
    * The Ruby community in Finland, what are we even doing here? (talk/discussion)
    * Talk
    * Networking

    Talk: TracePoint for fun and profit by Matti Paksula

    Ruby's built-in TracePoint API lets us hook into program execution in powerful ways. In this session, we'll explore how to use it to create a sandboxed execution context—catching method calls, restricting access, and preventing unsafe operations. Expect practical examples, challenges, and a discussion on its limits. Whether you’re into security, debugging, or metaprogramming, this should be an interesting dive into Ruby internals.
