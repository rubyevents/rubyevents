    Trailblazer is an extension framework on top of Rails. It provides
    desperately needed, new abstraction layers, decent encapsulation and a
    better maintainable architecture.

    In this workshop we're gonna learn the basics about designing your domain,
    encapsulating business logic in operations, form objects and view models,
    and a different take on the persistence layer. After a compact introducing
    presentation by Nick Kirkwood and Nick Sutterer, we'll dive into the code,
    write a small Trailblazer/Rails app and learn all the nice things about this
    alternative architecture over a cold bottle of beer.

    Sometimes everything just clicks, solutions just come to you and as you
    quietly tap away you feel almost at one with the computer, you're in the
    zone. At other times, nothing seems to make sense, you've been struggling
    with this one issue for hours and not even StackOverflow seems to know what
    the problem is. You feel like your brain is about to explode. Why even do
    this?! You're in the chasm.

    Join Richie & Dan as we explore what is "Developer Flow" and how it affects
    your productivity as a programmer.

    This workshop is designed for the post-beginner/intermediate developer who
    maybe has a few coding books, favorite gems and editor shortcuts under their
    belt but is still hunting for a more peaceful and focussed way to code.

    In an interactive full day workshop we'll discuss, pair, debate, compare and
    dig deep to help you find your own path to greater developer flow and
    finding your way more often into the zone. Richie Khoo is a serial polyglot
    and extreme learner. Richie Khoo has been working as a ruby gun-for-hire for
    over 6 years, has mentored devs as a Ruby Mentor at Thinkful and helped
    co-found Ruby Australia. Dan Draper has been a Rubyist since 2007 after
    throwing in the towel on Java. He was Chief Course Instructor at Coder
    Factory and has been a CTO and CEO of several companies.

    Go is a beautiful, minimalistic, and consistent language. It is simple, yet
    learning it can feel quite intimidating for many developers who come to the
    language without a background in Computer Science.

    Join Katrina Owen for this hands-on, one-day workshop, focused on developing
    fluency and ease with the fundamental features of the language. It provides
    a practical introduction to writing Go the way Gophers expect to see it
    written.

    Participants switch between writing code to solve small exercises, and
    reviewing pre-selected solutions that exemplify common gotchas and style
    violations. We look at the official recommendations relevant to each
    example. Finally we look at several idiomatic solutions that make good use
    of the language features.

    By the end of the day, participants should be comfortable reading Go code,
    and able to solve basic problems idiomatically.

    The ideal participant is currently programming professionally in a language
    other than Go.

You can take these lessons I learned the hard way and apply them to your creative work as a consultant, startup, or even within a larger organisation. Worst case scenario, we get to laugh together about things that seemed like good ideas -- at the time."

After all, the early pioneers of computer science were largely women and yet now only 6% of tech leaders are female. In Australia, the number of Aboriginal developers barely blips past 0%.

    Debugging Diversity performs a root cause analysis on diversity in tech and explains how it can be fixed. How each and everyone of us plays a role. Come and hear how over 2 years of research has culminated in a provocative, yet inspiring presentation.

    RubyConf AU 2016: Much has been said about the dangers with ActiveRecord, but the advice is usually limited to avoiding callbacks or not building God models. We still use it because there hasn't been a viable alternative. It is not actually a trait unique to ActiveRecord that makes it dangerous, however--it's because it's an ORM, and all ORMs must die.

    With Event Sourcing, we can build Ruby applications that are simple, scalable, extensible, and elegant without ActiveRecord or any other ORM anywhere in sight. We get a free time machine, and find out that Event Sourcing is a lot older than we might think.

    We’ll cover how the constituent parts fit together, how RSpec uses itself to extend itself and how some of the core protocols work.

    So why are many of us so stingy with feedback? Do we try to avoid difficult conversations? Do we know how to give feedback effectively? Whatever the reasons are, we can learn when and how to comfortably offer feedback to others.

    This talk will cover why feedback matters, what makes feedback effective, when and to give feedback, and much more.

    RubyConf AU 2016: Ruby makes programmers happy because of its elegant style and readable code. Rubyists like code that looks "right". Clever hacks and obscure use of syntax are frowned upon, and code linters and metrics are used to enforce a clean and idiomatic style.

    But there's a danger in this attitude. Innovations may look foreign at first, and by discarding them offhand we may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. On the flip side, libraries providing good looking interfaces may be smuggling complexity into your project that is hidden underneath the surface.

    “Besides not being as productive, what are the challenges of working remotely?” This and other questions are asked to distributed teams all the time. Presented by a remote manager and an employee with varying remote experiences in different companies, both successful and not, we’ll focus on real failures and teams that achieved success. Some remote teams don’t quite have it down, others wish their company understood them better. Even more folks want to work remotely but don’t know how to do it effectively. We’ll dive into each of these areas demonstrating failures and strategies that work.
