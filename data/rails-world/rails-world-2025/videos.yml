- title: "From Chaos to Clarity: Structured Event Reporting in Rails"
  speakers:
    - Adrianna Chang
  description: |-
    Events in Rails applications are like the heartbeat of your code - whether it’s a log, a telemetry signal, or a business event, they tell us when something interesting is happening. To truly harness he power of these events for observability and data analysis, we need high-quality, contextualized data. The human-readable lines that Rails.logger provides is great for manual inspection but falls short in production and analytics contexts.

    At Shopify, we recognized the need for a unified approach to events. After years of managing various in-house solutions for structured logging, we built support for structured events into the Rails framework itself. This talk will unveil the Structured Event Reporter, Rails’ new approach to structured events, and showcase how we’re using it to power events in our monolith.

  speakers:
    - Donal McBreen
  description: |-
    Long-running jobs can cause problems. They can delay deployments and leave old versions of your code running longer than expected. Interrupting them can leave data in an inconsistent state or cause redundant rework.

    Active Job Continuations let you define multi-step workflows or checkpoint iterations to track your progress, and they’re easy to integrate with your existing jobs. From there, they handle interrupting and resuming jobs across application restarts.

    We built Active Job Continuations at 37signals to make Basecamp's jobs container-friendly for deploying with Kamal. Come to this talk to learn more about how it works.

  speakers:
    - Hartley McGuire
  description: |-
    Databases crash, connections drop, and queries timeout at the worst possible moments. Rather than writing custom rescue code everywhere, Rails is revolutionizing how Active Record handles these inevitable hiccups.

    This technical deep dive explores key improvements in connection management, error handling, and recovery strategies introduced in Rails 7 and optimized in Rails 8. You'll learn how Active Record intelligently manages connection pools and retries failed queries.

    Whether you're running a massive production app or building a new side project, you'll walk away knowing how to leverage these features to build applications that bend instead of break when database chaos strikes.

    We started when Rails was “dead.” Everyone said it wouldn’t scale, wasn’t fast enough, and that no one used it anymore. Four years later, we’ve processed $1B+, handle 150k RPM, and run a feature-complete marketplace with real-time chat, notifications, payments, and live streaming - all on a Rails monolith with just 15 engineers.

    This talk breaks down how Rails gave us a competitive edge, the technical and hiring challenges we faced, and what Rails needs to improve to stay the best framework for startups.

  speakers:
    - Jason Meller
  description: |-
    Back in 2024, many of us in the Rails community dismissed passkeys as hype rather than a real password replacement. But now we're facing a serious problem - a newer and more sophisticated attack called Real-Time Phishing is gaining popularity and effortlessly defeating nearly all popular 2FA methods, except one: passkeys. Even security experts are getting fooled, and AI makes these attacks frighteningly scalable. In this session, I'll demo exactly how attackers execute real-time phishing live. Then we'll turn the tables: I'll guide you step-by-step through adding secure, user-friendly passkey authentication as an MFA option to your Rails 8 apps. Come on, Rails! Let's give passkeys one more chance.

- title: "Hotwire Native: A Rails Developer’s Secret Tool to Building Mobile Apps"
  speakers:
    - Joe Masilotti
  description: |-
    Building native mobile apps is time-consuming and expensive. Each screen must be built three times: once for web, again for iOS, and a third time for Android.

    But with Hotwire Native, you only need to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and then reuse them across all three platforms. If you already have a Hotwire-enabled Rails app, you can use the screens you've already built!

    And you don't need to be an expert in Swift or Kotlin. A thin wrapper for each platform enables continuous updates by only making changes to your Rails codebase. Deploy your code, and all three platforms get your changes immediately.

    Join me as I build iOS and Android apps from scratch, live. Learn the essentials, practical tips, and common pitfalls I’ve picked up since working with Hotwire Native since 2016.

    At Procore, our Rails monolith is massive - among the largest in the world - and intimidating to newcomers. I designed and taught a course that helped over 900 engineers of varying skill levels stop fearing it by teaching Rails and our monolith at the same time. Rather than using generic tutorials, we grounded everything in the actual product they’d be working on - layering Rails fundamentals with the domain-specific knowledge they really needed. In this talk, I’ll share how learning science, product context, and deep app knowledge came together to make our course work—and how you can adapt it for your team.

This talk goes beyond prompt hacking to explore what it takes to bring LLM-powered features into real-world Rails apps—with real users, latency constraints, and production consequences. We’ll cover architectural patterns like model orchestration, prompt versioning, and skill/tool design, all tailored to the Rails ecosystem. You’ll learn how to connect your LLM to internal APIs, business logic, and background jobs, while keeping everything observable, testable, and maintainable. Whether you're adding a smart assistant or orchestrating agents, you’ll leave with practical Rails-specific strategies and patterns to build it right.

  speakers:

    Rails is great. In fact, Rails has been great since the very beginning. However, in terms of technical details, Rails 1.0 was very different from Rails 8. Lots of things have changed, many frameworks have been introduced and overall quality has been polished.
    This leads to an interesting question. What makes Rails Rails itself? What core parts of Rails still remain after 20 years?
    In this anthropological talk, we dive into the source code of Rails 1.0 and explore internals.

- title: "Multi-Tenant Rails: Everybody Gets a Database!"
  speakers:
    - Mike Dalessio
  description: |-
    As Rails’s SQLite support has improved, it's finally possible to have truly multi-tenant Rails applications - isolated data for each account! - without sacrificing performance or ease of use. This talk describes a novel, production-vetted approach to isolating tenant data everywhere in Rails: the database, fragment caches, background jobs, Active Storage, Turbo Stream broadcasts, Action Mailer, and even the testing framework.

    You’ll learn how to build a new multi-tenant app or migrate an existing one. You'll learn the technical details of how Rails can support multiple tenants and strict data isolation. You'll see a live demonstration of a multi-tenant app. And you'll learn why a deployment topology like this might make sense for you, and how it scales up and out.

  speakers:
    - Paweł Strzałkowski
  description: |-
    Remember the joy of Rails scaffold creating web interfaces in DHH’s demos? Let’s make it just as simple for AI integrations!

    Imagine Rails scaffolding not just views for humans, but a parallel, AI interaction layer - out of the box!

    How? By embracing convention over configuration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the emerging standard (backed by Google & OpenAI) for AI-app interactions.
    Example: Scaffold a ReservationsController and instantly let an AI agent book a room via MCP - just like agents may use it with GitHub or JIRA today.

    I’ll show:
    - A full-stack AI-ready app scaffolded live
    - An AI agent using it
    - How backend, frontend, and AI layers cooperate
    - How to make your app speak AI natively

    Ultimately, this talk shows Rails’ competitive advantage for the AI era.

- title: "Ruby Stability at Scale"
  speakers:
    - Peter Zhu
  description: |-
    There are many talks, articles, and tutorials on how to monitor your Rails app for stability. These assume the source of the bug comes from your application code, from Rails itself, or from a gem. But what if the source of instability comes from Ruby or a native gem? If Ruby crashes, do you have any monitoring or ways to debug it?

    In this talk, we'll look at how we deal with Ruby crashes in the Shopify monolith, the world's largest Ruby on Rails application, and how you can use some of our techniques. We'll cover topics such as how we monitor crashes, capture core dumps for debugging, prevent crashes, and minimize the impact of crashes on production.

- title: "Lessons from Migrating a Legacy Frontend to Hotwire"
  speakers:
    - Radan Skorić
  description: |-
    Is Hotwire just for `rails new` scenarios and not worth it for mature applications? Absolutely not.

    I share my learnings from leading a migration of Halalbooking.com, a large hotel booking website, from a mix of technologies centered on React to Hotwire.

    Even though we couldn't enable Turbo Drive, we got a huge DX and performance boost from using other parts of Hotwire, making the migration more than worth it.

    I’ll share specific examples and lessons learned along the way. You'll leave optimistic about introducing Hotwire to a mature codebase.

    As a bonus, you’ll see:
    - When it's beneficial
    - How fast it pays back
    - How to introduce it gradually
    - Two concrete examples of complex Hotwire UIs

  speakers:
    - Snehal Ahire
  description: |-
    We realized our legacy code didn’t need a rewrite, it needed a performance plan.

    This talk shares how we tackled real production issues like memory bloat, slow queries, and Sidekiq queues piling up under load, where simple fixes like batching jobs or tweaking retries didn’t help much.

    We thought Active Record was the bottleneck, but fixing it only scratched the surface. We optimised query access patterns, chose more efficient data structures, restructured background jobs, and introduced smarter database caching and indexing strategies.

    I’ll share how we analysed query plans, fine-tuned database performance, and replaced slow, fragile logic with leaner, more explicit code paths that scaled better and failed less while Rails stayed right at the center of it all.
