Description:
    This generator creates a new video entry in videos.yml for an unpublished talk.
    It will create the file if one does not exist, and update a talk if the id matches.

Example:
    bin/rails generate talk --event-series blue-ridge-ruby --event blue-ridge-ruby-2026 --title "Your first open-source contribution" --speaker "Rachael Wright-Munn" --description ""

    This will create:
        data/event-series/event-name/videos.yml
