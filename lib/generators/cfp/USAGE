Description:
    Generate a CFP for an event in an event series.

Example:
    bin/rails generate cfp --event-series=rubyconf --event=rubyconf-2026

    This will create:
        A CFP file in the correct directory for the event series and event.
        The file will be pre-populated with a template for the CFP.
        Call it twice with the same cfp name to update the existing CFP.
        Call it twice with a different cfp name to append a new CFP to the end of the file.
