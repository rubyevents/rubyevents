Description:
    Generate a sponsors.yml file for an event series and event.
    Provide sponsor names and tiers as arguments in the format "Name:Tier".
    The first tier listed will be considered the highest tier.

Example:
    bin/rails generate sponsors typesense:Platinum AppSignal:Gold JetRockets:Gold
      "Planet Argon:Silver" --event-series tropicalrb --event tropical-on-rails-2026

    This will create:
        /data/tropicalrb/tropical-on-rails-2026/sponsors.yml
    with the sponsors organized into tiers accordingly.
